Hi all!

My name's <a href="http://twitter.com/dainmiller" target="_blank">Dain</a>, and I'm taking over as owner of TinyPress! Opeyemi has moved onto other interesting things! Super grateful to Opeyemi for being so helpful during the transition.

A little about me: I'm a senior developer, consultant, and a Ruby & web dev teacher/educator/coach. I would love to chat with anyone using TinyPress! Always feel free to email me: [dain@tinypress.co](mailto:dain@tinypress.co)
<br />

**We have a lot planned for the future of TinyPress**, here's a sneak peak...

1. iOS app
2. More themes on the web

Let me know what else you want! More updates coming!
