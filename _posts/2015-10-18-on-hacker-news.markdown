Hey there!

If you are coming to TinyPress from hacker news please feel free to ping me for feature requests. I know you guys are mostly programmers like myself, so I'm happy to dig into it with any of you. :)

Cataloging feature requests:

- <strong>Finished demo w/posts.</strong> I've decided to rebuild the gif on the homepage. It will include a demo and full walk through of the product from start to finish. This should help people understand how the product works. In the meantime if you check out [http://tinypressco.github.io](http://tinypressco.github.io) you can see what the Hyde theme looks like!
- <strong>Custom domains.</strong> We currently offer custom domains but the setting is buried, and we don't mention it on the homepage - so I will be adding a line item on the homepage for this feature.
