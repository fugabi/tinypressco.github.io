Hey there!

If you are coming to TinyPress from hacker news please feel free to ping me for feature requests. I know you guys are mostly programmers like myself, so I'm happy to dig into it with any of you. :)

Cataloging feature requests:

- <strong>Finished demo w/posts.</strong> I've decided to rebuild the gif on the homepage. It will include a demo and full walk through of the product from start to finish. This should help people understand how the product works. In the meantime this blog post you are reading is rendered using our "Hyde" theme. It's quite nice!
- <strong>Custom domains.</strong> We currently offer custom domains but the setting is buried, and we don't mention it on the homepage - so I will be adding a line item on the homepage for this feature.
